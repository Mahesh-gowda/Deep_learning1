Implementing Artificial neural network (ANN)

So quick reminder, the data set are informations of customers in a bank.

The bank gathered these informations and at the same time observed if the customer stayed or left the bank within a six month period of time.

And so the key thing to understand here is that all these variables here are independent variables and the last column here, exited is our dependent variable.

And so, we are trying to predict the results of this exited dependent variable from the informations of these independent variables.
